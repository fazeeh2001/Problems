Greater Average
You are given 
3
3 numbers 
A
,
B
,
A,B, and 
C
C.

Determine whether the average of 
A
A and 
B
B is strictly greater than 
C
C or not?

NOTE: Average of 
A
A and 
B
B is defined as 
(
A
+
B
)
2
2
(A+B)
​
 . For example, average of 
5
5 and 
9
9 is 
7
7, average of 
5
5 and 
8
8 is 
6.5
6.5.Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of 
3
3 integers 
A
,
B
,
A,B, and 
C
C.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if average of 
A
A and 
B
B is strictly greater than 
C
C, NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

```Python

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int, input().split())
    if (a+b)/2>c:
        print("yes")
    else:
        print("no")
